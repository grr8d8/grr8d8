- 👋 Hi, I’m @grr8d8
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a "git" type of app on my computer. I have currently wasted over 10 hours every single day for over 2 weeks and still nothing.  
I have finally figured out what some of the troubles are. The biggest issue is that when I tried to put together a very simple git program in Ubuntu 20.04 I was able to accomplish it. So, I figured I was ready to take the next step of trying to put together a bit client on my computer.  Then my computer broke.  So, when my new computer arrived, I decided to install one of the interim operting systems.  Unfortunately, I did not know that it installed without the z component. It had to be selected. Next thing I did not know was that there was a way to enter commands into the terminal as practice to see if it would work or not.  So, in all my attempts to install many different git programs, I found my computer chock full of all kinds of stu8ff that I don't know how to remove.  Then I find out the biggest problem is that most of these programs require a gnome component that can't be installed with this particular version of Ubuntu.  So, yesterday, I wiped my hard drive, reinstalled 21.01 and upgraded 3 months early to 22.04 so should now be able to finally practice and learn. 
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I am soooo incredibly stupid that I can't even install a git program on my computer despite having programmed linux for almost 20 years.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ..... I wouldn't even try at this point.  I thought coming to github would be the answer.  Not so far.
