- 👋 Hi, I’m @grr8d8
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a "git" type of app on my computer. I have currently wasted over 10 hours every single day for over 2 weeks and still 
can't get any git program to install.  They all stop at some point.  I would in particular like to have DevTools front end but tried several times and didn't get it. 
The only one keft to try is "git ubuntu"  I have the files but I can't imagine it being any different than the rest.  I open the read me MD foilder and they always 
pretty much nothing despite the fact that there should be instuctions on "how" to install it.  I just get 3000 lines of code - some of which I understand -
(anything I have to enter such as ID, module numbers, etc) can't be done as I don't know which things in brackets need information and which don't.  The instruction
come on several different pages so have absolutetely zero idea which page to start with. If I EVER needed an "out of the box" program, it is this one.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I am soooo incredibly stupid that I can't even install a git program on my computer despite having programmed linux for almost 20 years.  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ..... I wouldn't even try at this point.  I thought coming to github would be the answer.  Not so far.
